Aircraft Maintenance Data Warehouse & Business Analytics
This repository contains the documentation and scripts for a data warehouse project focused on aircraft maintenance data. The project was completed as part of the BAIT 3003 Data Warehouse Technology course at Tunku Abdul Rahman University College.

The primary goal of this project is to design and implement a data warehouse to analyze aircraft maintenance costs, technician performance, and operational trends. The system supports business analytics by providing insightful reports on various aspects of maintenance operations.

Project Structure
This project is divided into three main chapters as detailed in the full report:

Design of the Data Warehouse: This includes the logical and physical design of the data warehouse, featuring a star schema with a central MAINTENANCE_COST fact table and several dimension tables (DATE_DIM, TECHNICIAN_DIM, AIRCRAFT_DIM, AIRPORT_DIM).

Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) Process: This section contains the SQL scripts for the initial and subsequent loading of data into the data warehouse. It also includes scripts for handling Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD) Type 2 for the technician dimension.

Business Analytics Reports: A collection of reports generated from the data warehouse, providing insights into maintenance costs, technician wages, and aircraft reliability.

Data Warehouse Design
Logical Design
The data warehouse is designed using a star schema, which is optimized for querying and analysis. The schema consists of:

Fact Table: MAINTENANCE_COST

Dimension Tables:

TECHNICIAN_DIM (with SCD Type 2 implementation)

DATE_DIM

AIRCRAFT_DIM

AIRPORT_DIM

Physical Design
The physical design includes the CREATE TABLE scripts for all dimension and fact tables, defining the data types, constraints, and primary/foreign key relationships.

ETL Process
The ETL process is managed through a series of SQL scripts and procedures for:

Initial Loading: Scripts to perform the first-time population of the dimension and fact tables from the source database.

Subsequent Loading: Scripts for incremental updates to the data warehouse, ensuring that new data is added without disrupting existing records.

SCD Type 2: A procedure to manage changes in the TECHNICIAN_DIM table, preserving historical data by creating new records for updated technician information.

Business Analytics Reports
The data warehouse supports a variety of business intelligence reports, including:

Top 5 Airports by Maintenance Cost: Analysis of the airports with the highest maintenance costs, including a breakdown of the top 3 maintenance items.

Comparison of Maintenance Items: A comparative analysis of maintenance items between different years.

Aircraft Reliability and Cost Metrics: A year-over-year comparison of MTBF (Mean Time Between Failures), MTTR (Mean Time To Repair), availability, and maintenance cost trends by aircraft model.

Comparative Report: Maintenance Cost & Utilization a year-over-year

Maintenance Cost and Event Report by Year: A yearly report on maintenance costs and the number of maintenance events.

Top 10 Technician Average Wage Per Call: A trend analysis of the average wages for the top-performing technicians.

How to Use
This repository serves as documentation for the project. To replicate this project, you would need:

An Oracle database (or a similar SQL-based database).

The original source database schema (as shown in the report).

The provided SQL scripts for creating the data warehouse and running the ETL processes.

The business analytics reports can be generated by running the SQL queries provided in the report against the populated data warehouse.
