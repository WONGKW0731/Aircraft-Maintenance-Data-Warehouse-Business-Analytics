## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to design and implement a data warehouse to analyze aircraft maintenance costs, technician performance, and operational trends. The system supports business analytics by providing insightful reports on various aspects of maintenance operations.

---

## Data Warehouse Design

### Logical Design

- **Fact Table:** `MAINTENANCE_COST`  
- **Dimension Tables:**  
  - `TECHNICIAN_DIM` (with SCD Type 2)  
  - `DATE_DIM`  
  - `AIRCRAFT_DIM`  
  - `AIRPORT_DIM`  

The schema follows a star‑schema model optimized for query performance and analytic workloads.

### Physical Design

The `create_tables.sql` script defines:

- Column data types  
- Primary and foreign key constraints  
- Indexes for performance tuning  

---

## ETL Process

### Initial Loading

Use `etl_initial_load.sql` to perform the first‐time population of dimension and fact tables from the source system.

### Incremental Loading

Run `etl_incremental_load.sql` on a scheduled basis to append new maintenance records without impacting existing historical data.

### SCD Type 2 for TECHNICIAN_DIM

The `scd2_technician_dim.sql` script preserves history by inserting a new record whenever technician attributes change, using:

- Effective dates  
- Current‐flag indicators  

---

## Business Analytics Reports

The following SQL queries in the `reports/` folder generate key insights:

1. **Top 5 Airports by Maintenance Cost**  
2. **Maintenance Cost & Event Count by Year**  
3. **Comparative Analysis of Maintenance Items**  
4. **Aircraft Reliability & Cost Metrics** (MTBF, MTTR, availability trends)  
5. **Top 10 Technicians by Average Wage per Call**  

---

## How to Use

1. **Prerequisites:**  
   - Oracle Database (or compatible SQL‐based database)  
   - SQL client or IDE  

2. **Setup:**  
   ```sh
   # Create schema
   sqlplus user/password@db @sql/create_tables.sql

   # Initial ETL
   sqlplus user/password@db @sql/etl_initial_load.sql
````

3. **Scheduling Incremental Loads:**
   Configure your job scheduler (e.g., Oracle DBMS\_SCHEDULER or cron) to run:

   ```sh
   sqlplus user/password@db @sql/etl_incremental_load.sql
   ```

4. **Generate Reports:**
   Open and execute the SQL files under `reports/` to view analytics.
